1. Seems, Axboe's fast loop uses GFP_KERNEL in loop thread. What the fuck?

2. bio_add_page() is buggy. When existing bvec is extended, it passes
   some crap to merge_bvec_fn

3. BIO_RW_AHEAD. Nobody uses it. Should we implement this?

4. Switching io_context. Dubious. Definitely broken in 2.6.18

5. current->backing_dev_info. Investigate.

6. Waiting for free request. Should not we redo all the checks after waiting?

7. Cached write is used when allocating new index cluster. Should we
   get rid of this?

8. Investigate *congestion* methods. We should do something, no doubts.

9. Can/should we register_shrinker() to balance our internal caches?
