1. When mapping is not available (still not allocated or just
   not read from disk), bio preparation stage allows to
   virtual block boundary. In this case bulk writeback self-synchronizes
   to sending bios spanning the whole block and we do not have
   to waste time/io to pad those bios to block size, when
   creating new block, or reading original block, when making delta.

2. That block size is calculated from block size of top delta.

   It would be useful to have f.e. base image with block=128K
   and deltas with block=4K. In this case we quantize everything
   to 4K.

   Here is the assumption: successive deltas cannot increase block
   size. NB: raw image has infinite block size.

   BUT! When we start new delta, some bios can be already prepared
   and in this case we can see bio spanning several blocks.
   Right now we do not support this, therefore all the deltas
   and base image must have the same block size. What's about
   raw image, we just assign a default block size to base image
   and all the deltas must inherit it.
